🚀 Just launched my latest portfolio project: Momento 📱

I'm excited to share Momento, a mindfulness-focused mobile app I built from scratch using React Native and Expo. This app helps users capture and reflect on meaningful moments in their daily lives - both big and small.

✨ **Key Features:**
• 📷 Camera integration for instant photo capture
• 🎭 Mood tracking with emoji-based interface
• 📝 Reflective note-taking
• 🖼️ Beautiful gallery view with organized moments
• 📊 Statistics dashboard and daily streaks
• 🏆 Achievement system to encourage consistency
• 🎨 Clean, thoughtful UI design

🛠️ **Tech Stack:**
• React Native with Expo
• TypeScript for type safety
• AsyncStorage for local data persistence
• Expo Camera for device integration
• Custom styling with responsive design

This project demonstrates my skills in:
• Mobile app development and architecture
• User experience design
• Camera and media integration
• State management and data persistence
• Cross-platform deployment

The app is available on GitHub and ready for Play Store submission. I'm particularly proud of how I solved complex camera permission issues and created an intuitive user experience that encourages daily mindfulness practice.

Super proud of this one! The design philosophy was to create something that encourages mindfulness without the pressure to "go big" - just appreciating life's small moments.

## **Achievement-Focused Post:**

```
🏆 Portfolio Project Complete!

After weeks of coding, debugging, and design iterations, I'm thrilled to present Momento - my first complete React Native application!

This isn't just another todo app or weather app. Momento is a thoughtful mobile experience that combines:
• Professional-grade camera integration
• Beautiful, accessible UI design
• Complex state management
• Cross-platform compatibility
• Production-ready code quality

The biggest challenge was handling camera permissions across different Android versions - solved it by implementing proper permission flows and removing unnecessary audio permissions.

Ready for portfolio reviews and constructive feedback! 🚀
