# 📸 Momento

Momento is a mobile app for capturing and reflecting on meaningful moments - big or small - using photos, mood tracking, and short notes. It is designed to encourage mindfulness and appreciation without the false pressure to "go big" on moments.
Portfolio project built as a complete React Native application using Expo.
