- **When**: Only when you choose to save a photo to your camera roll
- **Data**: Photos are copied to your device's standard photo gallery (separate from app's private storage)

🗂 How Information Is Used

All data is processed and used exclusively on your device:

**Photo Processing:**
- Photos are automatically optimized (resized to 1200px max width, compressed to 70% quality) to reduce storage usage
- Optimized photos are stored in the app's private documents folder
- Temporary camera files are automatically cleaned up after processing

**Journal Data:**
- Journal entries (titles, notes, mood ratings, timestamps) are stored locally using encrypted device storage
- Achievement progress and app preferences are tracked locally
- Data is used to calculate statistics and display your journaling history within the app

**Optional Camera Roll Saving:**
- When requested, photos can be saved to your device's standard photo gallery
- This creates a separate copy in your camera roll (app's private storage remains unchanged)

Momento never uploads, syncs, backs up, or shares your data externally. All processing happens locally on your device.

🔐 Data Security

**Local Storage Security:**
- All data is stored in your device's encrypted storage
- Journal data uses AsyncStorage (encrypted by the operating system)
- Photos are stored in the app's private documents folder
- No data is transmitted over the internet

**Error Logging:**
- Error messages are logged locally for debugging purposes only
- Logs are never transmitted externally and remain on your device
- In production builds, only error logs are retained (info/debug logs are stripped)

**No External Data Handling:**
- No data is stored by the developer
- No data is shared with third parties
- No cloud storage, backups, or synchronization

You have complete control over your journal content. You can delete the app at any time to permanently remove all data.

🌐 Third-Party Services

Momento does not use third-party services, analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking tools.
